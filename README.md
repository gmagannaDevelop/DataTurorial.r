# Time Series Concepts

This repository is mainly focused on providing a basic introduction to the 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language/environment. 
R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. 
Together with Python it represents the _de facto_ standard in Machine Learning / Data Science.

All documents are writen in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) markup language and converted to HTML files to be served as part of this website.
