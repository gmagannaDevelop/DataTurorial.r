## Used packages
When working with R, we can define our own functions and create modules called packages which serve a specific purpose. These can be submitted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)(The Comprehensive R Archive Network). Publishing a package enables people to use the code you have developed!
In this case we are using the following packages:
```{r imports, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

# The regression problem
Imagine that we have a couple of variables which we know to be correlated. There is a variable we control $x$ and the second one $y$ is partially determined by it.
There is obviously some noise, some thing that we cannot control in the
measurement process or maybe the phenomenon is stochastic in nature.

## Assumptions underlying Simple Linear Regression
1. Values of the independent variable X are said to be fixed.
2. The variable X is measured without error.
3. For each value of X there is a subpopulation of Y values. For the usual inferential procedures of estimation and hypothesis testing to be valid, these subpopulations must be normally distributed. 
4. The variances of the subpopulations of Y are all equal and denoted by s2.
5. The means of the subpopulations of Y all lie on the same straight line.This is known as the assumption of linearity.

```{r data import}
full.data <- read.csv("../data/sensor_data.csv")
latest <- read.csv("../data/latest2.csv")
```


To see the oldest and latest dates of the full dataset, we take :
```{r full.dates}
full.data$DateTime[1]
full.data$DateTime[length(full.data$DateTime)]
```

Here we only have the latest values
```{r last.dates}
latest$DateTime[1]
latest$DateTime[length(latest$DateTime)]
```



# Full dataset

### Scatterplot
Here we see all of the data.
```{r scatterplot}
full.data.scatter <- ggplot(data = full.data, aes(x=ISIG, y=Glucose)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=mean(full.data$Glucose), linetype="dashed", color = "blue")
print(full.data.scatter)
```


### Regression
```{r fullregression}
full.data.regression <- lm(Glucose ~ ISIG, data = full.data)

summary(full.data.regression)

full.data.plot <- ggplot(data = full.data, aes(x=ISIG, y=Glucose)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)   # Add linear regression line 

print(full.data.plot)
```


# Latest observations

### Scatterplot
```{r latest.scatterplot}
latest.scatter <- ggplot(data = latest, aes(x=ISIG, y=Glucose)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=mean(latest$Glucose), linetype="dashed", color = "blue")
print(latest.scatter)
```


### Regression
```{r latest.regression}
latest.regression <- lm(Glucose ~ ISIG, data = latest)

summary(latest.regression)

latest.plot <- ggplot(data = latest, aes(x=ISIG, y=Glucose)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)   # Add linear regression line 

print(latest.plot)
```
